It is designed to protect against accidental errors in data entry but not malicious attacks. For example, on a website a user may enter a credit card number or ISBN and sometimes these numbers may be mistyped. One can then use the Luhn formula to determine if the entered number is a valid one.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>K-means clustering</title><link>https://mostafaeissa.github.io/post/k-means-clustering/</link><pubDate>Mon, 18 Oct 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://mostafaeissa.github.io/post/k-means-clustering/</guid><description>&lt;p>K-means is a clustering algorithm that is relatively old yet it still in use today because of its simplicity and power.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>How to Speak</title><link>https://mostafaeissa.github.io/post/how-to-speak/</link><pubDate>Thu, 04 Jun 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://mostafaeissa.github.io/post/how-to-speak/</guid><description>&lt;p>These are my notes for the lecture &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Unzc731iCUY">How To Speak by Patrick Winston&lt;/a>.
