It is a great book that talks about what why many data science projects fail. It is a very informative read and I suggest you check it out. In this post I will give a very quick summary of what I learned for my future self.</p><p>The authors highlight that It many data science projects fail evil at big companies. They have identified 4 themes (strategy, process, people and technology) that affect the success of data science projects.</p><h1 id=strategy>Strategy</h1><p>The main strategic failings are:</p><ul><li><strong>The need</strong>: there is a lack of need in the organization for data science projects this can be due to:<ol><li>A poorly defined use case that has no clear business value or solving a problem that is not currently a business priority.</li><li>No actionable insights generated by the project that can derive business decisions.</li><li>A solution looking for a problem; this could happen if a new hyped technology wants to be adopted without finding a proper use case.</li></ol></li><li><strong>Measure of success</strong>: projects fail because there is no clear definition of done and a measure of success e.g., what are the expected deliverables</li><li><strong>Buy-in from management</strong>: projects fail because there is no buy-in from leadership and management this could be due to lack of awareness, feature of becoming obsolete or internal politics.</li><li><strong>data-driven Decision-making culture</strong>: data projects need a data-driven or data-informed organizations that are analytically oriented. Projects fail in organization where decision making is driven by the highest paid person.</li></ul><h1 id=process>Process</h1><p>The main process failings are:</p><ul><li><strong>Data</strong>: Not having enough data or having too many data issues (e.g., missing, inconsistencies) will make it difficult to build successful projects that deliver value.</li><li><strong>Reasonable Expectations</strong>: data science and AI have received a lot of hype which usually sets up a lot of unreasonable expectations for a new project. It is important to set realistic expectations from the start given the data state and the expected time frame</li><li><strong>Clean and Continuous Communication</strong>: Lack of communication between the data scientists and business partners causes misunderstanding and disagreement of what the solution is or going to do</li><li><strong>Project Approach/Scope</strong>: Beginning with a too wide scope of too big a project will fail due to the complexities involved. Instead start with a minimum viable product or a simple model as a start.</li></ul><h1 id=people>People</h1><p>People involvement in data science is significant in every step of the process, and requires the development of many <strong>soft skills</strong>. Specifically, <strong>clear communication</strong> both in verbal and written forms.</p><h1 id=technology>Technology</h1><ul><li><strong>Proper Model</strong>: making incorrect assumptions, misapplying a model or not setting up a proper experiment design can lead to misleading results or failure to solve the problem at hand.</li><li><strong>Deployment to production</strong>: The data science solution and/or model is not useful until it is deployed to production and put in the hands of users. Deploying a model involves a lot of steps besides training such as availability and monitoring.</li></ul></div></div></section><section class=section><div class="container has-text-centered"><p></p></div></section><script src=//cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/highlightjs/cdn-release@10.2.0/build/highlight.min.js></script><script>hljs.initHighlightingOnLoad()</script></body>
