Hey there!

I'm Mostafa, a senior data scientist with a knack for turning data into insights that drive business decisions. My journey began over 8 years ago in software engineering, business consulting, and data engineering. With a background in computer engineering and a master's in data science, I specialize in machine learning, big data management, and business analytics.

What I love most about data science is its versatility â€” each project brings new challenges in different domains like e-commerce, advertising, and beyond. I enjoy collaborating with diverse teams to uncover insights that align with business goals.

Outside of work, I'm passionate about continuous learning. Through this blog and mentoring junior data scientists, I share insights and lessons learned along the way.
