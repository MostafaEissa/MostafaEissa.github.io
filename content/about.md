Hello there! 

My name is Mostafa. I got my BSc in Computer Engineering, then worked in industry for a few years in various business intelligence and data science positions. Later, I decided to go back to grad school, where I received an MSc in Data Science. 

Although my day job is data science, my interests in computer science are much wider. They include parallel and distributed systems, machine learning and compilers. Occasionally I write about things I find interesting.
