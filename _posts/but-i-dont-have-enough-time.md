Let me start by telling you a story about a wise man and his students. The wise man placed a large wooden box in front of his students and filled it with large stones, he then asked his students if the box was full. The students answered *"yes, it is full"*. The wise man then brought a large sack of pebbles and poured into the box. The pebbles being much smaller than the rocks, filled the spaces between the rocks.

The wise man then asked his students again if the box was full. The student replied *"Yes, now it is definitely full"*. The wise man looked at his students and brought a bag of sand and started pouring the sand into the box. Because the sand is fine it went through the spaces between the rocks and the pebbles.

The wise man then asked his students it the box was full. The students answered *"Yes, it is really full this time you cannot add anything else"*. The wise man then poured water on top of the sand. The sand was able to absorb the water and it did not spill out of the box which means the box was not completely full but there was still some space left.
