I was reading a book called [The Passionate Programmer](https://www.amazon.com/Passionate-Programmer-Remarkable-Development-Pragmatic/dp/1934356344)  by Chad Fowler. The books talks about what it takes to create a remarkable career in software development. It is a very good read and if you haven't read it yet I suggest you check it out. In this post I will try to one particular story that resonated with me.

In one of the chapter, the author tells a famous story about catching monkeys in south India. The story originally appeared in Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance by Robert Pirsig. It does not really matter whether the story is true but what is important here is what it signifies.

The people of South India, developed a new way to trap monkey as they are pestering people and causing trouble. They dig a long narrow hole in the ground and then use an equally long cylinder to widen the bottom of the hole and the bottom of the hoe is filled with rice.

Monkeys love to eat and as such they would come along, discover the rice and stretch their arms deep into the hole to get to the rice. They try to collect as much rice as possible and in the process they make a fist. Their fists fit in the wide part of the hole but as they try to pull out it gets stuck in the narrower end of hole.

Of course, the monkey could break free at any time by letting go of the rice but monkeys have a high value of food that they cannot let go. They will keep hold of the food until they die trying to pull it out. The author then explains that the story illustrated a concept called ***Value Rigidity***.  

> Value rigidity happens when you believe in the value of something so strong that you can no longer objectively question it.

In the story, the monkeys valued the food so high that when faced with the choice between food and captivity they could not understand that losing the food was the right thing at the time. The monkey is trapped but not by anything physical but rather an idea.

This made me thing about the monkey traps in my life. It is easy to develop value rigidity in our choices; we know what has worked and we keep doing it. Many times we hold on to our assumptions that they become blinding and we are unable to see that things are changing.

one of the most common traps we fall into is when we tell ourselves *I do not have enough time*. Usually, we use this excuse to avoid exercising to improve our health or avoid working on a personal project to imporve our career prospects. Each and everyone of us has something that will improve our quality of life yet we keep putting it off.

Let me tell you another story about a wise man and his students. The wise man placed a large wooden box in front of his students and filled it with large stones, he then asked his students if the box was full. The students answered *"yes, it is full"*. The wise man then brought a large sack of pebbles and poured into the box. The pebbles being much smaller than the rocks, filled the spaces between the rocks.

The wise man then asked his students again if the box was full. The student replied *"Yes, now it is definitely full"*. The wise man looked at his students and brought a bag of sand and started pouring the sand into the box. Because the sand is fine it went through the spaces between the rocks and the pebbles.

The wise man then asked his students it the box was full. The students answered *"Yes, it is really full this time you cannot add anything else"*. The wise man then poured water on top of the sand. The sand was able to absorb the water and it did not spill out of the box which means the box was not completely full but there was still some space left.

Often times when we examine our lives we wonder how did we get here? and how did we end up so far away from what we dreamt our lives would be? A lot of us have dreams or things we wanted to do but we keep putting off; we tell ourselves there is not enough time, I am swamped at work or I have to take care of the kids as soon as I finish this project or once the kids get a little older I will focus on my goals. But, surprise, surprise, years have passed you by and nothing changed.

I hope you realized the moral of the story; there are actually two important points to mention here. First, there is always more time, it all boils down to organizing your day and finding better ways to use your time. For example, as you commute to work every day you could try reading a book on your way or if you drive to work then you can listen to audio books. The point is if you look hard enough you will find the time to do the things you want.

Secondly, imagine the wise man started by filling the box with sand then he would have never been able to place any rocks in the box and the same applies for your time and how you manage your priorities. You need to dedicate time for the big stuff in your life (the rocks) and then find time for the less important stuff (the sand). However, If you spend four hours each day on social media then you will not find time to focus the important things.

Your previous actions are what led to your current situation but you action today are what determines your future and the decision is up to you. someone very smart once told me, the next year will pass, no matter what you do. Would you rather spend it working on your goals and achieving your dreams or keep doing what you do and then feel sorry for the time you wasted?
